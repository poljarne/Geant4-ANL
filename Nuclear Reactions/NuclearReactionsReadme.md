# Nuclear Reactions

This is where I expose the work done using Geant4, in the field of nuclear reactions. Basically I did two projects, all based on the photonuclear reaction 197Au(gamma,n)196Au, as the cross sections where measured in recent experiments. The goal is to study the photonuclear reaction model that G4 is using and see if it matches the experimental data.
